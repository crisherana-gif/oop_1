# Library Management System

## Description
A simple Library Management System implemented in Java for a student programming activity. The system uses three text files to store data:

- `users.txt` — user login details
- `books.txt` — book records
- `transactions.txt` — borrow/return logs

Features:
- User login (3 attempts)
- View all books
- Borrow a book
- Return a book
- Admin-only options: manage users, manage catalogue (books), view transactions

The program follows the specified class structure (Person, User, Book, Transaction, LibrarySystem), demonstrates polymorphism (Person reference to a User), and includes basic exception handling.

## Files included
- `Person.java`
- `User.java`
- `Book.java`
- `Transaction.java`
- `LibrarySystem.java` (main program)
- `users.txt` (sample data)
- `books.txt` (sample data)
- `transactions.txt` (sample data)
